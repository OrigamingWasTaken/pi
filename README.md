# pi

This is a simple motd program made in Python with Tkinter. I made it as a gift for my grandma (so that's why you'll see personal messages in `messages.txt`)
Run `./scripts/setup` to install.
Run `./scripts/setup uninstall` to uninstall.

Note: The archive folder contains the old code before the refactor. I kept it because it still can be useful.
